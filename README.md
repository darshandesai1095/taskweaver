# TaskWeaver

TaskWeaver is a simple workflow management system for orchestrating workflows using Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). It allows you to define tasks with dependencies and execute them in the correct order, with support for retries, parallelism, and error handling.

## Features

- **DAG-based Workflow Orchestration**: Define workflows with tasks and their dependencies.
- **Task Dependencies**: Tasks can depend on other tasks, which must be completed before the dependent task starts.
- **Parallelism**: Execute independent tasks concurrently for maximum efficiency.
- **Event Handling**: Custom callbacks for task start, completion, and error handling.
- **Dynamic Task Insertion**: Tasks can be added dynamically after the workflow starts and their dependencies are managed.
- **Retries**: Automatically retry failed tasks with configurable limits.
- **Timeouts**: Tasks have configurable timeouts for their execution.
- **Error Handling**: Built-in error handling and detailed logs.


## Installation

Install TaskWeaver via npm:

```bash
npm install taskweaver
```
## Sequential Workflow

This example simulates a basic sequential workflow where task execution is dependent on the completion of the previous tasks. By default, the process will start from the task(s) which have no dependencies, in this case, taskA.

```javascript

import { Workflow, Task } from 'taskweaver';

const tasks: Task[] = [
    {
        name: 'taskA',
        action: async () => {
            console.log('Executing Task A');
            return { result: 'A' };
        },
        next: 'taskB',
        retry: { maxAttempts: 3, delay: 1000 },
        timeout: 5000,
    },
    {
        name: 'taskB',
        action: async () => {
            console.log('Executing Task B');
            return { result: 'B' };
        },
        next: 'taskC',
        retry: { maxAttempts: 2, delay: 500 },
        timeout: 3000,
    },
    {
        name: 'taskC',
        action: async () => {
            console.log('Executing Task C');
            return { result: 'C' };
        },
    },
];

const workflow = new Workflow(tasks);

workflow.start()
```

## Branched Workflow

This example simulates a process where tasks execute based on conditions and dependencies. If the conditions are met, parallel tasks execute, and there are additional branches that handle user validation, data processing, and finalization.


```javascript
import { Workflow, Task } from 'taskweaver';

const tasks: Task[] = [
    {
        name: 'start',
        action: async () => {
            console.log('Start task executed');
            return { type: 'A' };
        },
        branches: [
            {
                condition: (result) => result.type === 'A',
                next: ['taskA', 'taskB'],
            },
            {
                condition: (result) => result.type === 'B',
                next: ['taskC'],
            }
        ],
        timeout: 3000,
        retry: { maxAttempts: 3, delay: 1000 },
    },
    {
        name: 'taskA',
        action: async () => {
            console.log('Task A executed');
            return { value: 42 };
        },
        next: 'taskC',
        timeout: 5000,
    },
    {
        name: 'taskB',
        action: async () => {
            console.log('Task B executed');
            return { value: 100 };
        },
        next: 'taskC',
    },
    {
        name: 'taskC',
        action: async () => {
            console.log('Task C executed (depends on Task A and Task B)');
            return { success: true };
        },
        dependencies: ['taskA', 'taskB'],
    },
];

const workflow = new Workflow('complexWorkflow', tasks, {
    onTaskStart: (task) => console.log(`Task ${task.name} started`),
    onTaskComplete: (task) => console.log(`Task ${task.name} completed`),
    onTaskError: (error, task) => console.error(`Task ${task.name} failed:`, error),
});

// Start the workflow
workflow.start();

```

## Configuration Options

### Task
When creating a workflow, you can customize the behavior of individual tasks by specifying the following properties:

|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`               | `string`                                                         | The reference or identifier for the workflow.                                                                       |
| `tasks`            | `Record<string, Task>`                                           | A record of tasks in the workflow, with task names as keys and `Task` objects as values.                            |
| `results`          | `Record<string, any>`                                            | A record of task results, where the task name is the key, and the result of the task is the value.                  |

## Dynamic Task Insertion
You can dynamically add new tasks to an ongoing workflow. When a task is added, it automatically updates the dependencies and determines if the new task can be executed immediately. By calling the workflow.addTask(newTask: Task) method within a taskâ€™s action callback, you can introduce new tasks into the workflow and trigger subsequent tasks based on evolving conditions, offering flexibility to adapt the workflow in real-time as the process progresses.

```javascript
  const newTask: Task = {
      name: 'taskD',
      action: async () => { ... },
      dependencies: ['taskA', 'taskB'], // taskD will execute immediatly after taskA and taskB have completed
  };

  workflow.addTask(newTask);
```

or

```javascript
// Dynamically adding a new task and branching based on a runtime condition
workflow.tasks['start'].action = async () => {
    console.log('Start task executed');
    const result = { type: 'A' }; // Simulate some result
    
    // Dynamically add taskD if a certain condition is met
    if (result.type === 'A') {
        const newTask: Task = {
            name: 'taskD',
            action: async () => {
                console.log('Task D executed');
                return { value: 'New task D result' };
            },
            next: 'taskC', // Connect taskD to taskC
            timeout: 2000,
        };

        // Add new taskD to the workflow
        workflow.addTask(newTask);

        // Modify branching logic for 'start' to include taskD
        workflow.tasks['start'].branches[0].next.push('taskD');
    }
    
    return result;
};

```

## Describing the Workflow
The describe method provides a log of the task dependencies, execution order, and branching logic.

```javascript
workflow.describe();
```

## Visualizing the Workflow
The visualize method generates an ASCII-based flowchart representing the task dependencies in your workflow.

```javascript
workflow.visualize();
```

This will print a flowchart to the console that visually shows how tasks are related and executed.

Example Output:

```bash
startup
    â”œâ”€â”€ taskA
    â”‚    â””â”€â”€ taskC
    â””â”€â”€ taskB
         â””â”€â”€ taskC
```
